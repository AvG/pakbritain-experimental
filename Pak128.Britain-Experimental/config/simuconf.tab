# "Base car preference percent" is the chance, expressed in percentage, that, all

# car in preference to using public (i.e., the player's) transport. Higher values
# are more realistic; lower values make the game easier.

# citizens per tile) is divided to get a factor multiplied by the number of cars
# per tile per month to get the congestion figure. In simple terms, the lower this
# number, the easier that it will be for cities to register as congested, and 
# the more likely that it is that passengers will opt for public (i.e., the player's)
# transport instead.

#
# "turntable_reverse_time" refers to trains/convoys that, as for the above category,
# cannot be driven from the rear, but that also require their locomotive to be turned
# around to face the other direction (such as steam locomotives with tenders) at the
# end of the journey. These will genearlly take the most time to reverse.
